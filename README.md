# OutlookCalendarSync

A simple utility to create synced calendar items between multiple Outlook calendars. If you maintain more than one personal Calendar for multiple orgs, this can help you keep your free/busy time correct for people in each org.

This was forked from my Outlook Google Calendar Sync utility for which the original source came from a codeplex project by Zissis Siantidis many years ago and I have modified and extended it to suit my needs.
